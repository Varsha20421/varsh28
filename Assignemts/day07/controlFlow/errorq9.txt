9. Analyse the code, identify the issues

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
float cnt = 0, num = 1000;
do
{
printf ("\n%d\n%d", num,cnt);
num /= cnt;
} while (cnt --); /* End of while */
return 0;
}

Errors:
1. in printf statement used %d, but num and cnt are of float type.So we have to use %f.
2. num is divided by cnt,but cnt initialized to 0,it will result divison by zero error
3. in while condition, c-- is used. It goes to infite loop.
